Abstract— This research focuses on the Business to Customer Model for Supply Chain (B2C SC) which covers
that of a retailer offering electronic goods to consumers as well as customer retention and feedback sentiment
in the B2C SC domain. Solving a customer retention problem for the customer to have faster demand requests
and better responses to their queries and analyzing customer feedback to promote better services and the
product delivery is crucial. Sometimes, customer service representatives don't have immediate answers and
they must transfer the customer to another person. That's how they serve multiple customers, and it is fair
enough to take a long resolution time to resolve the customer service tickets. However, the problem identified
in this research is customer retention with feedback sentiment. We studied research papers on customer
retention using machine learning conversation agents and to the best of our knowledge, we couldn’t find
researches that solve both customer retention with feedback sentiment using fuzzy search classifier, rule-based
approach, and Vadar Library. In this research, the B2C SCM covered the fulfilment of orders and the retailer
has to manage stock levels in warehouses. When an item in stock falls below a certain threshold, the retailer
restocks from the relevant manufacturer’s inventory. The system business rules were created using Transact
SQL Procedure and the fuzzy classifier function was written as a user-defined Function in Microsoft SQL
Server 2019. C# written in Dynamic Link Library was used to call the procedure and fuzzy function methods
from the Microsoft SQL Server and ASP.NET website was used to design the user interface for the users of the
system.
